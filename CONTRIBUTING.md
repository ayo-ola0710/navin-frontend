## About the Project

**Navin** is a blockchain-powered logistics platform that improves supply chain visibility for enterprises through tokenized shipments, immutable milestone tracking, and automated settlements.
By creating a zero-trust interface between logistics providers and their clients, Navin aims to ensure both parties access identical real-time data — removing information asymmetry and enabling seamless, dispute-free operations.

This repository is the **frontend** of the Navin platform — a React application that provides real-time dashboards for logistics companies and customers to track shipment status, visualize on-chain milestones, and monitor automated payment settlements.

- **Framework**: React (Vite)
- **Language**: JavaScript / TypeScript
- **Related Repos**:
  - Smart Contracts: [navin-contracts](https://github.com/Navin-xmr/navin-contracts)
  - Backend API: [navin-backend](https://github.com/Navin-xmr/navin-backend)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or later

### Fork & Clone

1. **Fork** this repository on GitHub.

2. **Clone** your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/navin-frontend.git
   cd navin-frontend
   ```

3. **(Optional)** Add the upstream remote to sync future updates: 
    You can sync through the github website though

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Navin-xmr/navin-frontend.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Picking an Issue

All open tasks for this repository are listed in [ISSUES](https://github.com/Navin-xmr/navin-frontend/issues).

Each issue has:
- The points lets you know how complex it is: 
- A **description** of what needs to be built
- **Acceptance criteria** — your PR should meet all of them before it will be merged

**Start with an issue with like 100 points or 150 points if it's your first contribution.**

Once you've decided on an issue, leave a comment and wait to be assigned before starting the work.

## Making Contributions

### Step 1: Create a Branch

Never commit directly to your fork's `main`. Always work on a dedicated branch.
Sync your fork first (via GitHub website or by pulling upstream), then:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main    # or: git pull upstream main

git checkout -b issue#<number>
```

**Examples:**
```
issue#9
issue#24
issue#51
```

### Step 2: Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code patterns and component structure in the project
- Keep each branch/PR focused on **one issue** only — don't bundle unrelated changes
- Add or update tests if the issue involves logic
- Make sure the app builds and runs without errors before pushing

### Step 3: Run Checks Locally

Before pushing, always run these:

```bash
# Check formatting
npm run lint

# Run any existing tests
npm run test

# Verify the build works
npm run build
```

Fix any errors or warnings before pushing.

## Commit Guidelines

Write clear commit messages so the history tells a story.

### Format

```
type: short description
```

### Commit Types we prefer

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | New component or page |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `style` | Visual-only change (CSS, layout), no logic change |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring with no functional change |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `docs` | Documentation changes |
| `chore` | Config, dependencies, maintenance |

### Examples

```bash
git commit -m "feat: build shipment tracking timeline component"
git commit -m "fix: resolve mobile layout overflow on dashboard sidebar"
git commit -m "style: update status badge colors to match design system"
git commit -m "docs: add JSDoc comments to API service functions"
```

---

## Pull Request Process

### Step 1: Push Your Branch

```bash
git push origin issue#<number>
```

### Step 2: Open a Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub and click **"Compare & pull request"**
2. Fill out the PR description:
   - **Title**: What you built (e.g., `feat: build notification dropdown`)
   - **Issue**: Reference the issue (e.g., `Closes #43`)
   - **Description**: Brief summary of your approach
   - **Testing**: How you verified it works — list what you tested
   - **Screenshots**: **Required for all frontend PRs** — attach a screenshot or screen recording of the UI you built. PRs without visuals will not be reviewed.
   - **Design file** (design issues only): Link to your design document in `docs/designs/`. 

### Review Process

1. **CI checks** run automatically on every push (lint + build must pass)
2. **Maintainer review** typically within 1–2 days
3. **Address feedback** — push fixes to the same branch of your PR
4. Once approved and CI passes, a maintainer will merge your PR

## Resolving Conflicts

Conflicts happen when other PRs are merged while you're working on your branch. 
Here's how to fix them: (This is just one way to do it, you can use the website to update your fork if that is the method you prefer)

```bash
# Update your local main
git checkout main
git pull upstream main    # or: git pull origin main

# Rebase your branch on top of updated main
git checkout issue#<number>
git rebase main
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Do not blindly accept both sides of a conflict.** Read each conflict carefully, understand what changed on both sides, pick the correct resolution (or merge intentionally), then verify the build and tests still pass before pushing.

After resolving:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build

git push origin issue#<number>
```
 You can also push your fix of the conflicts this way if you did the rebase method

```bash
# Push (force-with-lease is safe after a rebase)
git push origin issue#<number> --force-with-lease
```

PRs with unresolved or carelessly merged conflicts **will not be merged**.
We can't have any PR lead to issues on our repository so other contributors do not complain.
We want contributors focused on building, not cleaning up others' mistakes please.

## Code Standards

### General

- Write clean, readable code — favor clarity over cleverness
- Use consistent naming: `PascalCase` for components, `camelCase` for variables and functions
- Keep components small and focused — one responsibility per component
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling (see Tailwind guidelines below)

### Tailwind CSS Guidelines

We use Tailwind CSS for all styling. Follow these best practices:

#### Use Design Tokens
Always use our custom design tokens from `tailwind.config.js`:
```jsx
// Good: Using design tokens
className="bg-background-card text-primary border-border"

// Bad: Hardcoded colors
className="bg-[#0F1419] text-[#00D9FF] border-[#1E2433]"
```

#### Keep Utilities Readable
If a component has more than 10 utility classes, consider:
1. Breaking it into smaller components
2. Creating a reusable component with variants
3. Grouping related utilities logically

```jsx
// Good: Grouped logically
className="
  flex items-center justify-between gap-4
  px-6 py-3 rounded-2xl
  bg-background-card border border-border
  hover:border-accent-blue transition-all duration-300
"

// Bad: Random order
className="px-6 hover:border-accent-blue flex bg-background-card py-3 items-center"
```

#### Create Reusable Components
For repeated patterns, create reusable components:
```jsx
// Good: Reusable Button component
<Button variant="primary" size="lg">Click Me</Button>

// Bad: Repeating utilities everywhere
<button className="px-8 py-3.5 bg-accent-blue text-white rounded-full...">
```

#### Mobile-First Responsive Design
Tailwind uses mobile-first breakpoints:
```jsx
// Good: Mobile-first
className="flex-col md:flex-row p-4 md:p-8"

// Bad: Desktop-first
className="flex-row md:flex-col p-8 md:p-4"
```

#### When to Use CSS Files
Only create separate CSS files for:
- Complex animations with `@keyframes`
- Third-party library overrides
- Very complex pseudo-elements that are hard to read inline

For everything else, use Tailwind utilities.

#### Migration Reference
See `docs/TAILWIND_MIGRATION.md` for:
- Complete migration patterns
- Common component examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Design token reference

### Component Structure

```
src/
├── components/         # Reusable shared components
├── pages/              # Page-level components (one per route)
├── services/           # API service functions
├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
├── context/            # React context providers
```

### PR Size

Keep PRs focused. A PR for a single issue should not touch unrelated files.
